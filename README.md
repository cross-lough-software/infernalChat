Infernal Chat

A straightforward chat page written in Perl. Free of any extra useless baggage and encumberances. It could perhaps serve as a message board, guest list or notepad. It could be somewhere for throwing up those ideas you think are notable at the time but are actually useless.

Main script name: `infChat.pl`
